Service Overview
Antique Pharmaceuticals (Ayurvedic) is a famous and well-reputed Ayurvedic medicine manufacturer in Bangladesh, which is a hardly 120 km drive from the capital, Dhaka. This company was established in 2009 as a fledging alternative medicine manufacturing unit, Antique Pharmaceuticals (Ayurvedic) today is one of the largest manufacturers of ayurvedic medicine with a formidable presence all over Bangladesh. The company was mainly catering to the needs of some parts of the Northern districts of the country. At present this company is successfully operating in all the Eight divisions of Bangladesh through its’ Dealers and Marketing executives. The awareness of the safety aspect and other benefits of Ayurvedic medication is tremendously increasing all over the world, especially in Bangladesh. So, also the demand for quality Ayurvedic medicines is increasing day by day. The present facilities available in the country are unable to meet the ever-increasing demand. Being the traditional indigenous medical system the faith in Ayurvedic medication has also been a very influencing factor among people. Unlike the use of allopathic drugs, the preventive, curative, and restrictive nature of these medicines without any side effects or reactions is another favorable factor for the enhanced sale of Ayurvedic preparations. Moreover, the existing manufacturers in Bangladesh are not able to meet the increasing demand.

A business owner is an individual who owns and operates a business, small or large, with the aim of deriving profit from its successful operation. He or she typically makes all important decisions for the business, whether related to the product/service on offer or its infrastructure, and may work with partners or employees, or be the sole proprietor. Business owners typically follow established business models, preferring relatively low risk, and aim for moderate growth and profitability. They are contrasted with entrepreneurs, who tend to focus on new and innovative products or services, and run a higher risk with matching high profitability and rapid growth potential.

Service Overview
Priyo (aka priyo.com) is the largest news aggregator in the world in the Bengali language. Starting back in 2011 in Silicon Valley, USA, Priyo wanted to become the Yahoo of Bangladesh. Priyo started publishing its own content then. Along the path, Priyo started aggregating news from all reliable news sources in the Bangla language including BBC, VOA, AnandaBazar, Prothom Alo, etc. Priyo is serving millions of readers worldwide every month. Priyo started its e-commerce initiatives in January 2022. There are two fundamental issues in the e-commerce business in Bangladesh – a). Home Delivery (due to heavy traffic), and b). Cash on Delivery (COD) – which pulls back the efficiency of the delivery system. After many iterations, Priyo has launched 2 physical vans in Dhanmondi and Lalmatia areas to experiment with how customers buy from those vans!

Service Overview
"Ants Shop” –an e-commerce initiative of Intercloud, started its journey in Bangladesh officially in August 2019. Within a concise period of time it grabbed people's attraction. The first stage of this procedure is seller acquisition. Based on the need and demand of the consumer, the commercial team acquires the seller. The acquisition process takes one week to up to 3 months, depending on the brand or the product. After completing the legal formalities of the acquisition process the product/service gets on board on the Ants website. Thus the product, along with its detail becomes visible to consumers. People visit Ants website just like an actual marketplace to choose their desired item. Ants follows the commission model on each and every sale. People from all over the country can enjoy the easiest payment facilities of payment such as cash on delivery, Mobile Banking, all types of VISA, MasterCard, AMEX, bank transactions, etc. All that customers have to do is to place the order on Ants Shop’s website, and the delivery serviceman will deliver the product to their mentioned address. Ants Shop follows the e-commerce delivery time period set up by Bangladesh Govt. It takes 7-10 days to deliver a product. If any customer raises a complaint about his/her ordered product, we solve the issues or return or refund according to our refund policy. Our goal is to provide the best product at the best price. Also, to introduce the latest branded products in the market for the customers.

Service Overview
iEatery Business Model iEatery maintains a website and a mobile app that people can use to order food from their favorite restaurants and eateries. People can search for restaurants that deliver food to their addresses using iEatery's website/app. After choosing the restaurant, users can select their meals which are then added to the transaction cart. Once the meals are finalized, people can check out their cart and pay via online payment gateways or through cash-on-delivery. Once the order is confirmed, a notification goes to the restaurant. Every restaurant that partners with iEatery gets access to a 'merchant app'. The restaurant confirms the order and prepares the customer's meal. As soon as the order is confirmed by the restaurant, a 'delivery signal' is sent to all delivery partners via iEatery's 'delivery partner app'. The partner who accepts the request (delivery signal) is entrusted with the responsibility of delivering the customer's food. The delivery partner arrives at the restaurant to pick up the prepared meal and delivers it to the customer. Customers can track the entire process right from food preparation to delivery on iEatery's app/website. Live location tracking is a well-known trend in the food delivery business and iEatery offers the same. iEatery Revenue Model Commission From Restaurant iEatery charges commission from restaurants on every food order they receive through its platform. The commission is generally between 10% inclusive of all taxes. The commission is decided considering the restaurant's location, the restaurant's dependence on iEatery, and the number and kinds of orders. Delivery Fee From Customers There is a delivery fee for each order that a customer places on the iEatery app. Apart from this fee, there are other taxes that customers have to pay.Advertisement iEatery is a marketing platform for many restaurants, particularly newcomers. Restaurants can increase their visibility by registering on iEatery. They can also pay a certain amount to advertise their brand on the app. iEatery - Expenses Development and maintenance cost of its online ordering system. The system comprises iEatery's website, merchant app, customer app, delivery partner app, and the backend setup for managing everything. Salaries and provisions for full-time employees. Salaries and incentives for distribution partners. Administrative costs. Customers are given benefits in the form of offers. Returns and refunds. Online Ordering iEatery accepts orders through its website and mobile application. It connects customers and restaurants over the internet. Investment iEatery will invest 1 crore. They have already invested more than 30 lakhs. Global Operations iEatery has footprints in USA, and Bangladesh Quick Delivery iEatery is known for facilitating quick deliveries so that customers enjoy piping hot meals. Great Customer Support iEatery provides excellent customer support. It keeps experimenting with food menus and consistently partners with new restaurants. Therefore, customers can always expect something new from iEatery. Weakness Of iEatery Orders From Nearby Restaurants Orders are available only from restaurants that are located in the same location as the delivery address. This restricts the customers from trying out various restaurants. Tap On Free Delivery The quantity required for free delivery is at times way more than what one asks for or can afford. Coverage iEatery doesn't cover most of the cities completely. Customer Expansion iEatery should tie up with new restaurants and update its website/app for attracting foodies. Conclusion iEatery is making great strides. The team at iEatery is leveraging social media platforms to the fullest to engage customers. It has achieved considerable growth through email marketing, social marketing, and mobile marketing. If iEatery continues to innovate and improvise, it won't be long before it dominates the online food-ordering and delivery segment.

Brief of Company
In the last 3 years we have trained more than 10,000 thousands of learners. As it is online platform you don’t need any room or personal pc for every student. So we can run as many batch as we want but students need proper support from teacher as well from technical team. So we run 6 batches for every course. Weekly 3 days. From our last 5 year experience, we saw that as it is online course, almost 95% students choose course batches who will start at evening or night. So most of our batches start at night generally 7/8pm and another batch at 9/10 pm. We have 30 teachers right now at eShikhon and 30 courses, we have a skilled and experience technical support team for giving proper support to students. So we can run 6 batches for every course 6x30=180 batches, the number of students in every batch is 50, so we can train maximum. 180x50=9000, at a time.

RiBANA, a growing Bangladeshi brand where 100% organic and handmade skin and hair care products like natural soaps and oils are manufactured. It was established in 2015. Also, it was selected by UNDP for the YouthCo: Lab program in 2019. ‘RiBANA Organic’ is known for its organic skin and hair care products which are made of 100% natural ingredients and have no side effects. Besides, ''RiBANA Organic'' makes sure that glycerin is not extracted from the soaps which give soothing and moisturizing skin to the consumers, where most companies do not. Moreover, ''RiBANA Organic'' doesn’t add any color/scent/chemicals with its products. Without harsh chemicals, ''RiBANA Organic''’s skin and hair care products are less likely to cause allergic reactions, inflammations, or irritations. If an allergic reaction does occur with the use of organic products, it would most likely be due to a natural ingredient (neem, saffron, milk, etc ), which would be easier to identify.

Service Overview
Climate change is no myth, it is real and here to stay. In the backdrop of the lethal threat that the climate-change crisis poses to our existence and the increase in carbon emission through our day-to-day home and work activities, people are becoming more conscious about cutting down the amount of carbon emitted. We think of sustainable living as the positive things we can do in our daily lives to live better. But given the climate, biodiversity and pollution emergencies, we need to be clear on what those actions are and ensure that everyone needs to be taking them. Sabuj Sathi wants to promote awareness and consciousness among people and simultaneously take this opportunity to bring our native products to the spotlight as climate-friendly alternatives. Products sold at the center, among others, include- wooden and clay items, including utensils, home decor items, office logistics and stationery, jute products, safe food, plants, and fertilizers from recycled bio-waste. Sabuj Sathi ensures the climate and environment friendliness of each of the products. Using eco-friendly products improves the quality of life in terms of mortality, age, diseases, and illnesses. They ensure the safety of families and the planet. So our center has products that require minimum carbon emission in their production. The center sells plants that have been scientifically proven to have a more favorable impact on the climate and thereby promote more favorable plantations in the country. The center will cater safe and hygienic food. The center shows zero tolerance for unhealthy food and beverage. Sabuj Sathi wants to be able to bring a significant change in the consumption pattern of the customers of the country and thereby making an impact on climate change and high-carbon lifestyle scenarios in Bangladesh and beyond. And we wish to replicate this model country-wide and expect other businesses to come forward following our footprint to bring significant reduction in consumption-based carbon-emission. Activities of the Program • Climate change is a local and global concern in today's context. • Eco-friendly goods are the proven means to deal with adverse climate change issues. • Employment opportunities for the disaster-vulnerable community. • All profits go for reinvestment in projects/programs that deal with adaptation and mitigation strategies for adverse climate change issues. Major Objectives of the Program • Creating a positive social impact is our key objective. • Promoting sustainable business practices. • Promoting eco-friendly production and consumption. Linkage with the vulnerable community • Physically Handicapped operates Sabuj Sathi centered. • We always emphasize products prepared by people residing in the climate and environmentally affected arena Sabuj Sathi strictly maintains a no-plastic policy in the packaging of the products and will use environment-friendly packaging. Sabuj Sathi is a tech-driven entity- committed to keeping the use of paper at the center minimum, and all the invoices will be digital. Probha Aurora plans to expand the center in the future by opening one outlet in each division across the country. Two surveys will be conducted on customers visiting the center: a climate-friendly lifestyle survey and a customer-experience survey. During the climate-friendly lifestyle survey, the customers at the Sabuj Sathi- the Eco-Friendly Center will be asked to share their knowledge and perception about climate change and climate-friendly lifestyle. It will help us understand the extent of their awareness and efforts to address the problem and reduce carbon emissions on their part. The customers who do well in this survey will be allowed to take a photo in the photo booth of the center, which will encourage them in many ways, including being more aware of the climate change issue, adopting more climate-friendly, and making their shopping an emotional attachment with Sabuj Sathi- a fun experience as well. The Customer-experience survey is to get feedback from the customers on their experience and satisfaction with shopping with Sabuj Sathi- The Eco-Friendly Center. The knowledge generated from this survey will help us understand the consumer's tastes and preference and their insight as well that will go into making Sabuj-Sathi better and more capable of meeting the consumer's demands and reducing their carbon footprint as they live their daily life. Besides, through the learning, we want to develop standard procedures to advocate better food safety and packaging practices to the government. We also intend to use the learning in other initiatives, such as Climate Museum and Hygienic Food Stalls outside educational institutions. Thus, Sabuj-Sathi is not just a business venture but rather a part of the campaign of our greater initiative.

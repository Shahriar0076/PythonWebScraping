We have vast experience in implementing FloraBank Core Banking Software (CBS) in 8 (eight) local banks (NCC Bank Limited, Trust Bank Limited, Shimanto Bank Limited, South Bangla Agricultural and Commerce Bank Limited, Midland Bank Limited, Bengal Commercial Bank, Bangladesh Krishi Bank Limited and Padma Bank Limited), along with more than 2000 sites and branches throughout the country. 
With our vast banking domain expertise coupled with large IT infrastructure project deployment experience, we are very confident that we would be successful in satisfying our valued client while selecting and implementing the CBS project, as we did for other large IT products and services in the financial sectors of this country. It should be mentioned here that FloraBank complied more than 95% of Bangladesh Bank CBS Guideline 2016. Flora Systems Ltd. has developed and implemented so many solutions that are related to the CBS of the Banks like (BACH, BEFTN, RTGS, go-AML, HRM, Asset Management, Dashboard, Agent Banking, MFS, Internet Banking, Mobile Apps, Islamic Banking etc.). 
Flora Systems Limited is an active member of Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS). We have received ISO Certificate recognition of its Quality Management System which complies with ISO 9001:2015 and Information Security Management System which complies with ISO 27001:2013.  We have also appraised at CMMI Level-3 of the CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) for SVC, Version 2.0 by means of a standard CMMI Benchmark appraisal.
 It may be worthwhile to mention here that the Bangladesh Krishi Bank have satisfactorily transformed their legacy data to FloraBank CBS of their all 1038 branches with 1.5 crore accounts handled by 6000 concurrent users in a considerably short span of time.
In view of the foregoing and considering the fact we also like to inform that, BUET prepared a Review Report of FloraBank Core Banking System dated June 19, 2019. As per the said report, FloraBank CBS supports 6,000 concurrent users, number of branch support 1,668 and Transaction per Second (TPS) is 4,559 in a single low end configuration server. The TPS figure can be 3 to 4 times higher considering server capacity and configuration.
It is also tested by an international recognized testing company (UK Cert) which successfully tested “Based on Security, Management, Performance and load testing” of 5500 to 6500 Transaction per Second (TPS) and 6500 to 8000 concurrent users in a single server supporting more than 2000 branches and 20M accounts. We also assure that considering proper and adequate hardware support, our robust and dynamic new version of CBS FloraBank can handle unlimited concurrent users, number of branches and also number of customer accounts. It should be mentioned here that our new version of CBS FloraBank supports Window/Linux operating systems and SQL/Oracle databases.
We know that Islamic banking, an ideological banking and finance system, based on a frame within the Shariah Principles, has been initiated aiming to provide economically viable financial intermediation alternatives to conventional banking. We have developed FloraBank-"INSAF" software with all the regulations and sharia of Islamic Banking including all features and functionalities.
 It is noteworthy to mention here that we have replaced an internationally top recognized foreign CBS TEMENOS T24 in South Bangla Agriculture & Commerce Bank and Padma Bank with our “FloraBank Online Core Banking Software”.

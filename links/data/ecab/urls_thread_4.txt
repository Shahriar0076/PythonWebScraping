We are always open to new suggestions and will add an item to our inventory just for you. There is a "Product Request" feature that you can use to inform us of your requirement. You can also call +880-1829004055 or mail us at support@cybershop-bd.com to add an item to our inventory. Q. My order is wrong. What do I do? A. Please Immediately call +880-1829004055 and let us know the problem. Q. What if the item is out of stock? A. We hold our own inventory in warehouses, so we rarely run of out stock. However, we will try our best to source what you need. If we cannot find it, we will SMS/call you and let you know what substitutes are available. Q. What happens during a hartal? A. We work during hartals. That’s how dedicated we are. Q. Why should we buy from you when I have a store nearby? A. Well, that is up to you but you can also be a couch potato like our founders and have your items delivered to your house for free. Our prices are sometimes lower than that of major superstores in the city. We also carry a larger variety than the average corner-store. So, there is really no reason to not buy from us. Q. What about the prices? A. Our prices are our own but we try our best to offer them to you at or below market prices. Our prices are the same as the local market and we are working hard to get them even lower! If you feel that any product is priced unfairly, please let us know. Q. How do you deliver? A. We use our own fleet to deliver. Our goal is to deliver the products to your place on time. Q. What is your policy on refunds? A. You may get a refund within ten (10) days on unopened or spoilt packaged products. For diapers and perishable products, such as milk, fruits and fresh vegetables, we have a one (1) day return policy. We will not accept any diaper items as return if more than 20% of the pack has been used. We reserve the right to refuse a refund. Please contact us at +880-1829-004-055 if you want to return an item. Q. Can I get a refund via cash? A. No, for any sort of issue, we will update the credit to your Cybershop account. Q. What is your discounting policy? A. We try to provide the best deals in Dhaka and many of our products are already discounted below the maximum retail price (MRP). We also offer discount codes under special circumstances, which are applied on the MRP. On any given product, we can only apply one type of discount. We always consider the best discount available to the customer. For example: If the MRP of a product is Tk. 100 and our list price is Tk. 92 -- the product is already sold at a 8% discount. This means that if user applies a discount code for 5% discount, we will still consider the best discount available to the user and sell the product at Tk. 92. Q. Can I order over the phone? A. Absolutely. Our hotline is +880-1829-004-055. Q. What about quality? A. We try our best to source the best quality items for you but if you are dissatisfied, you can always send them back with the delivery person. If you forget to do that, you can call us within 3 days and we will replace the item for free. Q. How are you sourcing your products? A. We have deals with whole-sellers, manufacturers and importers. We only sell authentic products. Q. Should I tip the delivery representative? A. Tips are not required. But our delivery team members appreciate recognition for their hard work. Delivery representatives keep the entire tip amount.

Service Overview
"Hellotask is an Uber-like technology platform to connect verified and skilled domestic helpers to users on-demand basis. Though 10M people work as domestic helpers in Bangladesh, it usually takes more than 7 days to source a domestic helper through social relationships and word of mouth. Further, the average salary of a domestic helper is below US$70 per month. Hellotask gives its users an Uber-like user experience to hire a helper in 5 minutes and gives the helper income opportunity up to 3X through a skill-based training program. In partnership with international development organizations including Oxfam GB and BRAC, Hellotask is working to train more than 16,000 domestic helpers to formalize the care economy through its platform. The World Bank also recently partnered with Hellotask to conduct a 2 year-long research on the impact they are creating in the care-economy in Bangladesh. Hellotask has 50K+ App downloads and 38K registered users on their platform. Within 2 years Hellotask has generated US$150K in sales. Hellotask is growing 50% month over month as the demand has increased after the withdrawal of lockdowns. Hellotask envisions to revolutionize the care-economy across Asia. "

China Bazaar is a newly established Bangladeshi chain shop brand which currently operates in Dhaka. The Company was founded in 2018 to sell Show Piece & Gift Items. From May 2019, we start selling electronic and home appliance products. In the same year, we unanimously decided that we would change our business goals. We then decided that China Bazaar would sell all the products people need, from needles to cars. With this goal in mind, China Bazaar is currently selling more than 5000 products. In December 2019, we decided to create an e-commerce site under the banner of China Bazaar, which would enable customers not only in Dhaka but also outside Dhaka to purchase our products online. In this series, we launched our online site called www.chinabazaar.com.bd and it is constantly evolving.

Our Goal: Our main goal is always to provide good products and satisfy customers. Customer satisfaction is our perfection. We want to move forward with customer satisfaction. We want to spread a touch of satisfaction to all customers in the country and around the world. Our Vision: We will ensure the satisfaction of our customers by faithfully meeting their needs. Our slogan is "Creating a better world for the future". We will spread the message of satisfaction all over the world with the love and satisfaction of the customers. The demand for authentic products is everywhere. There is no denying the necessity of this. By good or pure product we usually mean adulterated food, which reaches us from the beginning to the end without any adulteration. But as easy as it is to say, the real is not so sweet. In order to survive in the competition in the market of cheap and adulterated products, the market today is full of harmful adulterated products. This responsibility is not only of the sellers, this responsibility of all of us. Therefore, effective steps are needed to improve the situation. Surma Shop started its journey to connect consumers with authentic and non-adulterated products. We try to create some belief in this market of disbelief, that yes, the genuine product is still there, and that is within reach.

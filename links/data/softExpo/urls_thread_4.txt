Bangladesh's 1st NFC Digital Smart Business Card | INTRO Just Tap or Scan to automatically open your customized Landing Page. Update, Change, Delete, Hide or Add new Info anytime. We all know that networking is a great way for company owners to grow their businesses. Sharing business cards is a powerful networking strategy and tool. It's the most popular approach to growing your company. To promote networking, all salespeople visit clients, sales fairs, other trade shows, and so on. They give their contact/company information via traditional business cards. However, the surprising truth is that more than 82 percent of traditional business cards are trashed away. That implies you and your organization are losing business opportunities every day, all of the time. People are naturally anxious to save contact information from a paper business card to their phone. When a customer needs to contact you, they are unable to do so since they did not save your contact information, and as a result, they seek out another vendor similar to you. We at INTRO™ have come up with a solution for you. INTRO™ helps you to share your contact details with people. Consider how quickly your and your company's networking will grow if your and your company's information is saved to another phone. To provide you with a better user experience, we are constantly improving our internal system application. We think it's the most straightforward approach to exchange your contact information and broaden your network. We treat our customers as our partners. Your success and ease of networking is our goal.

A Marketing & Sales Startup for iCircles Products and Services in Bangladesh
Introduction: Digital Bangladesh is our 21st century development movement initiated by our Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. We feel proud to say that under the stewardship of Sajib Wazed Joy and ICT Ministry, we are making a steady progress with each day passing to make our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s dream come true. We have identified iCircles products and services to be of high value and impact for Digital Bangladesh. In order to launch and integrate iCircles products and services into Digital Bangladesh via private sector initiative, we have created a locally adaptive unique marketing & sales startup – Lemmesay Ltd which is registered with RJSC as a limited company bearing certificate no: C-186362/2023. Lemmesay Ltd will create local conditions including content creation and technical adaptations conducive to successful launching and implementation in Bangladesh of iCircles products and services, which are developed by iCircles LLC, a US technology company registered in the state of Ohio, USA. To our delight, we want to mention that iCircles LLC is also run by non-resident and resident Bangladeshis. This has created a special interface for Bangladesh. We think iCircles products and services will bring in game changing effects in every aspects of our socio-economic life stretching from urban to rural areas covering all spectrum of sectors, ushering us into next generation technological excellence.

Our children have increasingly exposed to thecyber world, and more unique forms of harassment appear that parents, teachers, and guardians need to be aware of. In the meanwhile, data and information are threatened in the way of smallerscale scams like identity theft and mobile-banking hacks as well as larger-scale attackslike the 2016 Bangladesh Bank cyber heist.

China Bazaar is a newly established Bangladeshi chain shop brand which currently operates in Dhaka. The Company was founded in 2018 to sell Show Piece & Gift Items. From May 2019, we start selling electronic and home appliance products. In the same year, we unanimously decided that we would change our business goals. We then decided that China Bazaar would sell all the products people need, from needles to cars. With this goal in mind, China Bazaar is currently selling more than 5000 products. In December 2019, we decided to create an e-commerce site under the banner of China Bazaar, which would enable customers not only in Dhaka but also outside Dhaka to purchase our products online. In this series, we launched our online site called www.chinabazaar.com.bd and it is constantly evolving.

Brief of Company
Background Electricity and livelihood development is the two sides of a coin. It is certain that in the course of time, there will be no conventional fuel reservation on our planet for the production of electricity. Renewable energy technology will be the ultimate source of energy to produce electricity. At present, the cost of renewable energy technology for the production of electricity is comparatively higher than the production cost of electricity by using conventional energy resources. Unfortunately, in developing countries, most of the underprivileged people who live in remote areas have no access to grid electricity. As a result, they cannot use their full potential for the development of their livelihood. However renewable energy technology can be a solution for generating electricity in remote rural areas but due to the high investment cost of technology such (privileged) people cannot afford the technology. Appropriate financing mechanisms and guaranteed support services can popularize PV technology in remote rural areas. BSL Trade International (BSL) was founded in April 2016 by a group of committed people who have long experience in the renewable energy sector. All key persons of BSLTI are highly and have more than 25 years experience in solar power including energy-efficient technology in Bangladesh. The company is completely equipped to meet your energy demand anywhere in Bangladesh. No matter if it’s your industrial commercial or household demand. BSL is a professional renewable energy services and solutions provider addressing electricity and energy challenges by improving access to and promoting the adoption of clean and energy-efficient technologies. Our company is setting the pace to realize the development of a green economy with low emissions, resource efficiency, and social inclusivity. This is being achieved through the efforts of our knowledge-driven team and network of internationally qualified experts within the fields of renewable energy technologies sustainable development and engineering. We are dedicated to creating sustainable solutions and enriching lives by reducing energy poverty, and providing long-lasting and consistent solutions for households, businesses, and communities. Vision Sustainable livelihood development through dissemination of renewable & energy efficient technology. Mission ? Promotion of renewable energy efficient technology ? R & D to produce renewable energy and energy efficient product ? Provide quality backup service to ensure sustainable market development Values ? People- All dealings towards the sustainable development of livelihood ? Environment- Doing business for a green environment ? Commitment- Keeping commitment at any cost ? Quality- Nonnegotiable Strength & Opportunity BSL Trade International professionals are highly qualified in their relevant fields. They are experienced in renewable energy technology. They are trained at home and abroad. Its sourcing capacity is very wide and competitive. At present renewable energy is an alternative source of power for the people of remote areas. So, the promotion and demand for quality service in renewable energy technology is growing very fast. In addition, renewable energy technology is environment-friendly technology and its harnessing has no bad impact on our planet. In addition to the Conventional Street Light for the TR / KABITA project, BSL has recently introduced a remote monitoring system solar street light (2G). The current phase (Phase 1) of the present fiscal year (2019-2020) will be piloting some of the TR / KABITA projects, and IDCOL has decided to install a full street light remote monitoring system solar street light (2G) in the second phase. In addition, BSL is marketing and installing modern technology LED street lights in Bangladesh.

Service Overview
Businesses want to make customers happy. A happy customer results in a repeat customer and potential customer referrals. One strategy a business may use to attract customers is to provide a full service experience for the customers. Customers want to go to a business where all of their needs and wants can be met. The full service meaning is the offering of a variety of related services to the customer so that the customer's needs and wants can be met by one business. A few examples of full-service businesses are gas stations, banks, hotels, airlines, and marketing agencies. The goal of the business is to create a business model that makes it easy for the customer to receive all the services they need of that kind from one company. It benefits the customer because they do not have to research and use multiple businesses to complete the services they need. It benefits the business because it can help develop customer loyalty and repeat customers. Customers tend to look for convenience, efficient service, and enjoyment.

Service Overview
In Bangladesh, thousands of students depend on private tutoring as their primary source of income. However, the lack of a reliable medium or matchmaking agency that can verify tutors’ identities and measure their quality and ability to teach has led to significant issues. Tutors often misrepresent themselves, and students and guardians are left dissatisfied and sometimes cheated. Sometimes, the students or guardians also cheat the payment of the tutor. I would like to bring to your attention the pressing challenges faced by tutors and students in Bangladesh, particularly in relation to false identities, payment issues, and the complex requirements involved in the tutoring industry. Recently, many tutors from the University of Dhaka reported payment disputes in social media, and a good number of students and guardians complained against many tutors. But, no authentic and responsible agency is working in this industry which can make a right match and troubleshoot those issues. Today, everybody needs to create CV, Resume and Cover letter for various purposes. Most of them need assistance to create. Usually they go to any typist and get it done. But it is a costly and time consuming practice We believe that these challenges present an opportunity for an innovative solution that can benefit both parties and create a positive impact on the education sector. To address these challenges, we have developed Ostadjee, a smart platform with a vision to provide a comprehensive solution for students, tutors, and guardians. Our platform focuses on several key areas: Identity Verification, Quality Assessment, Payment Guarantees, Consultancy Services, Support for Job Seeker, CV, Resume and Cover Letter building, and Educational Blog. We have developed a sustainable revenue model for Ostadjee. Options such as charging a commission or service fee for successful tutor-student matches, offering premium features for tutors or students,CV, Resume and Cover Letter building and partnering with educational institutions for advertising or sponsorship opportunities ensure the platform's financial viability.

Telcobright Limited –listed company in telecommunications Services sector of Bangladesh. Telcobright is managed by a group of young professionals with wide range of experience in the field of ICT and telecom. We are here to help provide the best customer experience for customers and achieve business objectives of clients in the most cost effective and quality driven fashion. Telcobright has the right core competencies to deliver the project successfully. We have discussed our relevant experiences and skills with you in meetings with list of notable projects that we have won or delivered through our profile and web site. These includes: Also, other than having core competence in Telecom, SS7, VoIP, signaling and SMS- we have ready solutions for various telecom services, such as Billing and Business Support System (BSS), Multiple Protocol SMS Gateway and integration with top level open source ERP projects. However, as CCL have come up with a very comprehensive set of requirements with lots of custom integration and future expansion possibilities, no vendor can offer a 100% ready solution. You need a solution that will serve the most important needs off the shelf and can evolve in the future. Not all vendor have 100% control and understanding of opensource telephony projects and often fail to extend or change the system to fulfill the requirements of a customer of your standard. We promise you a 100% extensible system and a sincere commitment to deploy the features over a holistic period of time. We organized features module-wise and breakdown the whole project plan into three phases. The phase one will cover 70% of the whole project. Please note that, we will calibrate the project plan based on the client need. So Telcobright is open to re-shuffle the plan and accommodate the client’s priority.

Like almost everyone we were struggling to find the perfect milk. We sat down one day and tried to figure out how to solve this problem, and then came Beshuddho. We decided to find a solution to have pure unadulterated milk delivered to your doorstep. Solving the problem was no easy task! We are now sourcing the purest milk from the healthiest cows, following the industry standards to chill the milk, then pack in sterilized glass bottles and deliver them right to your doorstep in insulated delivery bags. Problem? Solved.

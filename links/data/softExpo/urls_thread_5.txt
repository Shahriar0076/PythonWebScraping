Company Details
OpenRefactory's mission is to protect organizations from catastrophic risk of software failure. We do this through our proprietary SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tool called Intelligent Code Repair (iCR). We are a Silicon Valley based deep-tech software startup backed by decades of research in our domain. Our innovative and ground-breaking technology is endorsed by none other than the 2021 Turing Award Winner, Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Ullman of Stanford. We are the Champion of Bangabandhu Innovation Award (BIG) 2021, organized by Govt of Bangladesh. We are also a Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Global Co-Innovation (COIN) Partner.
Intelligent Code Repair (iCR) detects Security, Reliability, Vulnerability and Compliance bugs in source code that other tools miss with 5x-10x more precision and can automatically FIX those detected bugs with minimal human intervention. iCR currently supports teams using Java, Python, Golang and C.
iCR allows developer teams to operate at premium velocity without compromising the quality. iCR is to be deployed privately as a license subscription with CI/CD integration or for on-demand use. Contrary to other tools, iCR 'comes to you' to ensure source-code confidentiality and security; iCR does not report anything back to mothership.
iCR is priced based on the scanning capacity of lines of code. Unlike regular lines of code where whitespaces are counted as LoC, iCR calculates LoC excluding the whitespaces, which we call OpenRefactory Bundled Lines of Code (OBLoCs).
OpenRefactory’s iCR has been built on 15 years of research by our Founder & CEO, Dr. Munawar Hafiz. Dr. Hafiz is considered to be the pioneer automated bug detection and fixing and had been backed by Microsoft, Google, DOE, NSF, BIG etc. in his research. Our other Founders are Mr. Charlie Bedard who has more than 30 years of experience in software engineering and management and Mr. Mushfique Manzoor who has more than 20 years of experience in Business Development and General Management in Telecom and Startups. The technology behind iCR of OpenRefactory’s has been endorsed by none other than the Turing Award Winner of 2020, Prof. Dr. Jeffery Ullman of Stanford University. Our other advisors include domain experts from US, Europe and Asia.
For an online demo of iCR, please email to info@openrefactory.com

Company Details
Digital marketing has changed the structure of traditional marketing in any given industry in Bangladesh thanks to all the companies, from newbies to long-established ones, for their massive contribution to such a revolution. While the whole world was benefiting from the ripening seeds of digital marketing for growing their revenue, Bangladesh was a little step behind, but that has changed with the hands of digital marketers. With such vast and talented digital marketers, Softnmart is another addition to success in this field, helping the new start-up counterparts dominate their own marketplace and niches. A heartiest and warm thanks go to our ICT sector for allowing the companies like Softnmart to stand on its shoulder amidst all the odds and obstacles. The ICT sector has kitted us out with all the necessary tools, robust internet connectivity, and an easy-to-attend tuition center where thousands of prospects are graduating to hold the hands of a company like ours to advance toward digital success. Softnmart itself is a self-growing start-up, facing enormous challenges and obstacles in its earlier days. Still, due to our solid effort and clever tactics, we learned to dominate the digital industry. That’s why our understanding of the recently emerging start-up companies is way more empathetic and compassionate. Our biggest strength is our workforce, and versatile adaptability to any given pressure as our tech-savvy have the capacity and talent to bring fruitful outcomes to clients’ simple to super-complex projects. Their years of experience and the perfect mixture of pragmatic-theoretical knowledge help to solve any digital-marketing-related tasks at the right time within the specific budget. Our previous case studies and a bag full of accolades speak of it. Our digital marketing has an unequivocal goal – bringing in the resources and capacity of your company and refining them to build a distinctive and inimitable strategy and enforce it to bring the ROI to your company. Softnmart has what it takes to boost your company’s desired outcome in such a short span of time with no extra costs involved. Our longstanding working relationship with foreign entities and the international market has thus led us to build a working environment compatible with international standards. Our active policy, ethos, moral ethics, and environment represent by far the most internationally recognized working atmosphere of any other contemporary digital marketing agency in Bangladesh. Softnmart wasn’t what you think of it as it is today; its root started off with paper fibre trading in the ’90s with the hand of its board of directors. After a series of ups and downs, like any robust and established company, Softnmart has undergone such steps and finally turned into a formidable digital marketing company that helps us recall the hard work we strived for and the moral ethos we foster to pass it on to our future hard-working generations.

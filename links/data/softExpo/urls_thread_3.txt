MACHINE LEARNING (ML) & ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Machine learning is a subfield of AI (artificial intelligence) or a pathway to AI. Machine learning uses algorithms to automatically learn insights and recognize patterns from data, applying that learning to make increasingly better decisions. By studying and experimenting with machine learning, we test the limits of how much they can improve the perception, cognition and action of a computer system.

Deep learning is an advanced method of machine learning, goes a step further. Deep learning models use large neural networks, networks that function like a human brain to logically analyze data to learn complex patterns and make predictions independent of human input.

The goal of AI is to create computer models that exhibit “intelligent behaviors” like humans. Machines can then recognize a visual scene, understand a text written in natural language or perform an action in the physical world based on this computer models.

We, DHPl specialized in Machine learning and AI, train required computer models for object detection, face detection and classification etc. We successfully use our trained computer models for various customer applications in different platforms, e.g. Android, Linux and Windows.
IoT & INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Internet of Things (IoT) usually refers to interconnected sensors, controllers and other devices networked together in an industrial setting. This connectivity allows for remote access and monitoring, but more importantly, it allows for data acquisition and collection, exchange and analysis of different data sources. IoT has enormous potential and benefits for improving productivity, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. IoT solutions are characterised by low cost and fast implementation.

Industrial automation is the use of data-driven control systems, such as industrial computers, PLC controllers or robots, that reduces the need for human action by operating industrial processes or machinery. Connecting industrial equipment (e.g. PLC, robots, actuators, sensors) to the cloud - and sharing real-time data can dramatically impact the efficiency, production and uptime and helps to develop next generation machines.

The IoT plays an important role in industrial automation and we, DHPL can help you in industrial automation to create systems that are effective, affordable and flexible to your needs.

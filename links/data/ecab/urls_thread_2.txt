Service Overview
Agricare Global Ltd mainly works for the small-scale farmers of Bangladesh. We have created an agri-tech model to ensure the betterment of the farmers so that they get finance or profit after vending their crops. We select the areas or zones according to various aspects and appoint a representative of that specific zone. We provide funds only to those farmers who belong to that specific area. After receiving the finance, farmers start cultivating, and our representative monitors the whole process. If the farmers need any instructions regarding cultivation, our experts are always available to share knowledge with them. When the crops or products are ready to sell, they sell their crops through AgriCare or vending to the local market and return the profit with the funding amount to AgriCare. We also do vegetable trading. We source vegetables from local areas and make sure the farmers get genuine prices from his crops. We generate the whole trading process by our strong supply chain system.

Service Overview of CIRCLE What we believe is that a little extra income can provide us monetary independence, and with the essence of technology, everyone can start earning extra money from home. Housewives, students, or low-income employees can use a portion of their spare time and earn by starting an online business. Challenges do exist, due to the requirements of investment, inventory management, delivery management and so on. However, if we can overcome these challenges for them, they will be able to start an online business with less difficulty and will be able to empower themselves. With that mission in mind, we put our slogan ‘Empower yourself’. We have broadened that vision to include small business owners who are struggling to sell and compete in the era of internet and e-commerce. We can help these small businesses to grow, if we can make it simple for them to establish online presence. CIRCLE is working with that mission of empowering individuals (particularly women) and small business owners to pursue their dreams of becoming entrepreneurs. Anyone with an entrepreneurial spirit can start their own business or online business with zero investment and earn money with joy and pride. CIRCLE provides individuals/small business owner access to a virtual store with millions of products from trusted suppliers, inventory management, payments and shipping facilities and other tools. While we perform all the heavy-lifting, users of CIRCLE may smoothly sell products to their network and earn. All that is required is a mobile phone with internet connections! and a little time, as well as an entrepreneurial spirit. We believe in the transformative power of technology and we can use those power to empower those who needs and thus change the world for better. For the internet users of Bangladesh, CIRCLE offers all the back-end support to build and start an online store and start making money right away. To define who we are - we are the online business enabler for the individuals and small business owners. We are happy to serve any query info@circle.com.bd

In 2020 the world was suffering due to Covid-19, and getting quality food was a big challenge. Especially, fresh and natural food collection was quite impossible, and there were very few places to get those. So Ahsan Jan Siddique finally put up the courage and introduced Grameen Ponner Hat to serve people the best organic products from his local neighborhood in Pabna. From there the business is serving more and more people every day and by 2025, the company plan to diversify its service and introduce more products with a smooth online service so that people can maintain good and healthy food habits and thereby reducing the toxins in our lives and our environment. Our Vision Introduce a chain of organic foods and related products while providing convenient digital and in-store support to the nation. Our Mission Our mission is to provide high-quality, local, fresh, organic & natural foods and related products to people & create an awareness about healthy living while representing the rich culture of Bengali cuisine.
